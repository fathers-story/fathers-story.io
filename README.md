# Story of a father

This is my story, I call me as Vijay and I want to protect anonymity of my child and myself. But I need to leave these stories here on public. The story if injustice, abuse of women's laws, corruption, money, and all the things that suck. For, just get access to my child.

# Beginning
I am 38 years old as of today. I born in a village in Kerala to a lower middle class family. I am not sure if such classes exists, but yeah, in India you can draw such lines easily. 

# 2015
I decided to get married. I found a well educated girl from keralamatrimony.com. Some of my previous relationships were terribly failed and I decided to go through this arranged route. I got married in May, 2015 hoping that life will be great!

# 2015 Feb - a prequel
Their family moved quite fast and I was not fully prepared financially to get married in short span of time. I somehow arranged my funds, and we got engaged in February 2015. I started seeing some basic issues, that the girl has very high temperament, and I wasn't less either. But I decided to be patient and adjusted some of behavior to see if things would workout. 

Their parents wanted to prepone the marriage to 3 months earlier to ensure that we are not ending up in bad conflicts. I was handling everything myself, and I have mother and unmarried sister at home.

# 2015 June
Our honeymoon did not happen due to various reasons. I stayed away from work for more than a month, I was financially broke, and we had several relatives visits. The mood swings were evident with her, and we slowly became silent at home and we did not even want to crack a harmless joke at home.

# 2015 July
She resumed her studies, and there about 1 year pending. We made some patches and we had unprotected sex before she went to resume her studies

# 2015 August
I came to know that she's pregnant and her fights continued as we were not really able to deal with the distant relationship. The girl make demands that I need to travel every week which was difficult considering my lower back pains, and some shitty projects that I was handling then. Things were slipping away.

She refused to come to my home for Onam, and it was our first Onam after marriage. In Kerala Onam is a big festival time. 

# 2015 October
I was sent to U.S for a project assignment for a week and she wanted to tag along. Unfortunately she did not have a U.S visas and the time available was short to arrange one. I promised her that we will travel together next time. 

I made the call before my flight took off, and she hung up call saying this "I will abort the kid by the time you land in the U.S". Fuck! I lost my senses, I was sweating out, helpless and I called one of her aunts and informed this, and the cellular connections dramatically cut off.

I landed in San Francisco and checked back if everything is okay. She was okay, and I had the worst 24 hours in my life.

# 2016 April
My kid was born, she did not stay with me during pregnancy. Her parents and she made some moves and resumed her residency in her hometown. Our distance was widening and I was hopelesly traveling to her place every week after a 5-6 hours drive one way. I often end up unopened gate, alone at midnight where no place to stay. I slept in my car some times, sometimes cheap lodgings, or sometimes expensive hotels if nothing available.

My lower back and eyesights started developing severe issues. At the same time, I was losing at my work. Internal politics took my jobs away, I was not happy while dealing with these messes back home. My son Axel (changed name for privacy) born, almost 6 weeks before than expected.

On the same day, one of my friends grandfather passed away and I started already to our hometown along with his wife, and my mother. I got a call that my wife is admitted and may deliver soon. We reached around 2 AM at the hospital, and the baby was born and pre-mature at about 6 weeks.

I dropped my mom and friend's wife at our hometown nearby, and came back in the morning. Next day my mom came in to visit the child but she was harshly asked to leave due to her mood swings. 

We were being clueless what's going.
