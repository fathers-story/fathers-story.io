# Story of a father

This is my story, I call me as Vijay and I want to protect anonymity of my child and myself. But I need to leave these stories here on public. The story if injustice, abuse of women's laws, corruption, money, and all the things that suck. For, just get access to my child.

# Beginning
I am 38 years old as of today. I born in a village in Kerala to a lower middle class family. I am not sure if such classes exists, but yeah, in India you can draw such lines easily.
